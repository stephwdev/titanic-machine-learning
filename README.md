# Kaggle Machine Learning Project - Titanic

For our intro to machine learning course we were tasked with building machine learning models to predict if a passenger survived the tragedy or not. This project was worked on with 2 other team members.

This project was completed using Jupyter Notebooks. The models we used were the following:
- SVM
- Decision Tree
- KNN
- Neural Networks
- Ensemble Methods
